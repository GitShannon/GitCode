In order to keep the Curlybars code base nice and tidy, please observe these best practises when making contributions:

- Add tests for all your code. Make sure the tests are clear and fail with proper error messages. It's a good idea to let your test fail in order to review whether the message makes sense; then make the test pass.
- Document any unclear things in the code. Even better, don't make the code do unclear things.
- Use the coding style already present in the code base.
- Make your commit messages precise and to the point. Add a short summary (50 chars max) followed by a blank line and then a longer description, if necessary, e.g.
